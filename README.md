# Files needed to run the Server and Client

# How to start the server
In order to run the server you need to open the command line or powershell and navigate to the directory of where the file is located.
Once you do that you can start the program by typing this command `java -jar Server.jar`

Once you do that you this should pop up
```text
Opening Socket
Socket is open
```
Seeing this means that the server is now running and waiting for users to connect.
